# personal_website_with_pure_html
I wrote my personal website in html using the knowledge I learned from the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp">Angela's WebDevelopment course</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">mdn docs</a>. 
You guys can also write these kind of program to check what we have learnt and after knowing about html it is mostly manipulating text whether your bold the text or italize the text or link a text to website it's your wish. You can do most of things with text.
